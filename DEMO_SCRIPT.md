  - Display document list with metadata
- **Narration**: 
  - "Let's start by uploading some documents. The system supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT files."
  - "Documents are automatically processed, cleaned, and split into overlapping chunks for optimal retrieval."
  - "You can see the processing status and manage your uploaded documents."

### 4. Basic Query and RAG Functionality (90 seconds)
- **Visual**:
  - Ask a simple question like "What is machine learning?"
  - Show the answer generation process
  - Display sources with relevance scores
  - Show confidence score
- **Narration**:
  - "Now let's ask a question about our documents. The system uses RAG to find relevant chunks and generate a synthesized answer."
  - "You can see the sources used, their relevance scores, and the confidence level of the answer."

### 5. Advanced Features (120 seconds)
- **Visual**:
  - Show filters panel (file type, language, source)
  - Demonstrate advanced search
  - Show query history
  - Export results functionality
  - Settings panel (max results, temperature, model)
- **Narration**:
  - "The system includes advanced features like filtering by document type, language, or specific sources."
  - "Query history helps you quickly repeat previous searches."
  - "You can export results and customize search parameters."

### 6. API Documentation and Testing (60 seconds)
- **Visual**:
  - Show Swagger UI at /docs
  - Demonstrate API endpoints
  - Show request/response examples
- **Narration**:
  - "The system includes comprehensive API documentation with Swagger UI."
  - "Developers can easily integrate with the REST API for custom applications."

### 7. Technical Highlights (45 seconds)
- **Visual**:
  - Show code snippets of key components
  - Display test results
  - Show logging and error handling
- **Narration**:
  - "The system includes comprehensive unit tests, error handling, and logging."
  - "Key features include query expansion, document reranking, and metadata extraction."

### 8. Conclusion (30 seconds)
- **Visual**: Show the complete system in action
- **Narration**: "The Knowledge Base Search Engine provides a complete solution for document-based question answering with advanced RAG capabilities, making it easy to extract insights from your document collections."
